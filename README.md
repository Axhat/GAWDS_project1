# GAWDS_project1
DESCRIPTION
This is a physics engine made in javascript.
The phenomenon shown in this project is of repitive collison of two animated object.
One big block coming from the one side with small block constrained to collide with the the bigger block.
NOTE: there is no click interaction with the engine except with the alert coming first.
WORKING:
There is a function defined where all the motion and path of the two blocks is defined with the help of if and different path and mass equations which is runnng in loop to make the collison and change in the speed of the two blocks possible.
