# GAWDS_project1
DESCRIPTION
This is a physics engine made in javascript.
The phenomenon shown in this project is of repitive collison of two animated object.
One big block moves in fixed direction(leftwards) while small block is constrained to collide with the the bigger block.
NOTE: there is no click interaction with the engine except with the alert coming first.
WORKING:
There is a function defined for  all the motions and path followed by two blocks .
It is defined by using:
1.)IF 
2.)mass equations
which are runnng in loop to make the collisions and change in the speed of the two blocks possible.
